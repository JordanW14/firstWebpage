<h1 class="heading"> Holy Moonlight Sword </h1>
<img class="picture" src="HMS.png" alt="Holy Moonlight Sword">
<p class="text"> An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig.
    When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave.
    <a href="https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Holy+Moonlight+Sword"target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer">The Holy Moonlight Sword</a> is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort.
